# The CHT Artwork & Goodies Design Contest

Welcome to the Design Contest of [The Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com)!

![The Center of Humane Design](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/57f92f5bf5e231f7e7aaa0ae/t/5a768ebb652dea12df04d0b9/1517719227886/Social+Share+Logo-v2+-+2018-02-02.jpg?format=1000w)

The purpose of this contest is to come up with some really cool artwork that we can use in our media awareness campaigns to draw attention to our mission and [The Problem](https://humanetech.com/problem) that we want to solve. 

And also to produce some great-looking apparel that we can proudly wear at events and in public. T-shirts and caps and the like, that can be ordered online.

Which great things of beauty and powerful symbolism can we come up with to show our commitment to Humane Tech, and make others aware of our cause?
Who can make the coolest, most gripping original artwork, and convey our message best? This is the challenge for the competition!

So are you a graphic designer? Or do you have ideas or sketches for artwork? Maybe you have some great, cool, or funny slogans or hashtags to contribute? Then chime in, add your suggestions, and either join the contest, or help the participants improve their work.

Any contribution, no matter how small, is most welcome!

The ongoing efforts of the participants will be shared with the community in a pinned topic and the final artwork that gets the most likes is the winner of the contest. We would love to **award the winners with some great prizes**! (but this depends on donations, read more below).

No matter if you win, any contribution is **greatly valued**! And - while this community is still rather small, we expect it to grow significantly in the near future - you may attract some _real_ attention with your art, and - who knows - may even _become famous_!  :smile:

## I'd like to join the contest! How can I participate?

You can join the contest as a participant by either:

- Dropping a line to [the contest organizer](https://community.humanetech.com/u/aschrijver/summary) in a private message on the [Community Forum](https://community.humanetech.com).
  - He'll help you get started with Github and together we'll onboard you to the contest.
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/engagingspaces/humane-tech-artwork/issues/new) in the contest repository. In the issue you should supply the following information:
  - A link to your profile summary, so we know who you are, e.g. `[MyForumUserName](UrlToMyProfileSummaryPage)`
  - The `Submission` tag, so others know you joined as well and can add comment and feedback
  - (optional) The Name of your submission, if you already have one in mind.
  - (optional) A description of your submission idea, if you already know that.
  - (optional) The intende use of your artwork, e.g. T-shirt (front, back), baseball cap, or other uses

If you have a name for your submission and files to upload, then the [repository maintainer](https://github.com/aschrijver) will create appropriate sub-folders and README's for your submission, which you can then maintain yourself.

**Note**: You can participate in the contest with _as many submissions as you like_! The more the better :smile:

## How can I help the contestants?

Not participating? You can still join the fun! Start brainstorming and come up with powerful Symbols :peace_symbol:, Slogans :speech_balloon:, Taglines :zap:, and Hashtags  :hash: for the participants to use in their work. Slogans and taglines that convey the urgency of our mission, or that are just plain funny.. everything that draws the right attention. Every contribution is welcome, and can inspire others

Here is a first idea for a hashtag, though we am sure you are much more creative:

> #### #MUSE #OnceMore
>
> Which stands for: **Make Us Socially Engage Once More!**

We also already have the first tagline, which was suggested by our member [patm](https://community.humanetech.com/u/patm/summary):

> #### Concerned, aware, involved!

## Help find and donate nice Prizes for contest Winners

To make this contest really interesting and competitive (in a good way) _it would be **fantastic** if we could come up with some nice prizes for the winners and 2nd + 3rd places_. Do you have an idea? Are you prepared to donate a nice gift or gimmick? Then chime in!

The prizes should (probably) constitute something digital, because the winners can be from anywhere on our great planet. On the other hand a real-world artifact would be most fitting to CHT.

Use this issue to cooperate and brainstorm: [What are nice prizes for contest winners? Can you donate?](https://github.com/engagingspaces/humane-tech-artwork/issues/2)

## Help find ways to print and sell CHT Apparel and Goodies

There are many great companies that print T-shirts and the like at low-cost and have great online tools as well as webshops to make this really easy. Your help is needed to select the best one! Let's try to find the one that complies best to Humane Tech principles and reward them with our patronage.

Other goodies for which artwork is created are mouse mats, stickers, cups, etcetera. We may make that part of the contest, but the focus is first and foremost on having some nice peaces of clothing to show off with.

The requirements are:
- **Low-cost**  - in production as well as sales prices (but humanely produced)
- **World-wide delivery** - our (current and future) members are _everywhere_!
- **Easy-to-use** - preferably a DIY web app where you can bring all things together easily

Use this issue to cooperate on this: [What is the best online Apparel design tool and webshop?](https://github.com/engagingspaces/humane-tech-artwork/issues/1)

## How do I work with this repository?

Any files that you create should be added to the folders that were created for you. So:

- Add concepts, drafts and sketches to your sub-folder in the [Concepts](https://github.com/engagingspaces/humane-tech-artwork/tree/master/concepts) directory.
- Add your final submissions and design files to your sub-folder in the [Submissions](https://github.com/engagingspaces/humane-tech-artwork/tree/master/submissions) directory.

For participants as well as non-participants the ongoing work can be discussed by commenting on the `Submission` issues in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/engagingspaces/humane-tech-artwork/issues).

The directory [CHT Official](https://github.com/engagingspaces/humane-tech-artwork/tree/master/cht-official) contains official artwork of the CHT organization that you can include in your designs.

Besides the `Submission` issues in the issue trackers, you can create issues with other labels:

- `Help wanted` - For requesting help from others (e.g. to help complete your submission, select apparel webshops, etc.)
- `Idea` - For submitting ideas for submissions, or brainstorm on slogans, taglines, hashtags
- `Improvement` - For improvements to the contest (e.g. to suggest / donate prizes)
- `Question` - For getting help on working with the repository, or other general questions

In the issues you can use Markdown format, which is the same format that is used to write posts and messages in the forum. Read [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to see the formatting that is available.

## Licensing, copyright and attribution of submissions

As in all original work you automatically retain the copyright. In addition you can select an appropriate license for your work. Though not required we suggest you use a public domain [creativecommons](https://creativecommons.org/) license.

A good license would be Creative Commons for Non-Commercial use, and either with or without Attribution requirement. Use [this handy tool](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) to find the best option.

You should add the licensing option of your choice to your own README file in the same way it is done here (by copying the html from the licensing tool) and take care that your artwork and design files have the appropriate metadata set as well (most software allows you to add properties like name, license URL, etc.).

If you do not specify a license, then the default license defined for this repository applies, which is [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (which means free for any purpose, provided that proper attribution is given). See the full notation in the [License](#license) paragraph at the bottom of this README.

## Aditional information about the contest

### When does the contest end?

The contest remains open as long as needed, depending on participation. An end date on which all participants agree will be determined later.

### I saw the Contest announcement in the forum, but I cannot comment. What gives?

A pinned, but locked, topic has been created for announcing the Contest: [Join the CHT Artwork & Goodies Design Contest and Win!](https://community.humanetech.com/t/join-the-cht-artwork-goodies-design-contest-and-win/1868)
This topic is managed by the contest organizer and will contain preliminary results as well as finished submissions. It is also the place where the winners will be announced.

But for general discussion there is a separate forum topic: [CHT Artwork & Goodies Contest - General discussion](https://community.humanetech.com/t/cht-artwork-goodies-contest-general-discussion/1803)
